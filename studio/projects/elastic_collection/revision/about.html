        <p> Fatima: "The use of vibrant color in film has become synonymous with
           contemporary film; so for this idea I wanted to get stills from films
          made after 1990 and organize them based off of color. All shots will be
          predominantly the color chosen; and it will be filtered out based on 7 colors.<br>
          <br>
          I have a appreciation for film, especially color in film so having a website
          that organizes film shots based off of that would be really cool."
