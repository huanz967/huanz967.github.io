  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li class="alternate">Leftover rice</li>
    <li>3-4 eggs</li>
    <li class="alternate">chinkiang vinegar</li>
    <li>light soy</li>
    <li class="alternate">pinch salt</li>
    <li>a good handful of green onions finely sliced, e.g. 1 oz</li>
    <li class="alternate">30ml veg oil, plus 1tbsp for egg</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h3>How to make:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>whisk 3 eggs well before pouring them into a quite hot pan,<br>
      which has a splash of veg oil. They will start frying up immediately,<br>
      and begin to turn with a spatula so that the cooked parts are folded over as soon as they are done,<br>
      allowing the liquid parts to reach the heat. Within 30 seconds all your egg should be cooked,<br>
      break them up into larger or smaller pieces as desired.<br>
      put egg back into its mixing container.</li>
      <br>
    <li>heat a good glug of oil (e.g. 1floz) in wok until shimmering<br>
      but nowhere near smoking, and add green onions, and fry onions gently<br>
      for at least 2min.</li>
      <br>
    <li>Lower heat and stir if the onions look like they will brown.<br>
      Add the loosened rice and toss/stir until well coated in the oil.<br>
      (For crispier rice, add more oil in the beginning, press the rice down<br>
      a little and wait a little longer, giving it lots of contact with the hot pan.)<br>
      keep tossing til all the rice is well heated and softened, then add a good splash<br>
      of soy sauce and keep tossing. Don't overdo the soy sauce, and add a pinch of salt to taste.<br>
      the soy should lightly brown everything and be well distributed before you add the egg.<br>
      Add the egg. Combine another 2min and serve.</li>
  </ol>
